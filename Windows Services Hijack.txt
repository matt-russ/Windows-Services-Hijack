When an attacker lands on a target machine, one of the most common ways to elevate their privileges to System is by discovering a windows service that is vulnerable to a hijack attack. One way to discover these vulnerable Services is by querying the running services, and excluding any that are running out of the C:\windows\ directories. The Windows directories are being excluded because they are not writable by an unprivileged user. If an attacker finds a Service that is running an executable out of a directory that is writable by an unprivileged user, then they will preform a DLL hijack in order to elevate their privileges to system.
